Last year I spent six weeks in India. It was wild. I got the chance to see the Taj, hike through mountains, and eat mindblowingly good food. But the traffic is what I'll remember most.

I'd been to Vietnam twice before (my parents' homeland and similar motobiking enthusiasts) but there's something about adding cows into the mix that makes Indian traffic. Traffic back home in Sydney is absolutely drives me up the wall - there probably isn't a day where I'm not cussing at silly pedestrians or non-indicators. Yet there's something so fun about Indian traffic, despite all of its chaos - granted, I'm not the one driving but when you're in an autorickshaw, with how close you are to the driver, it goddamn feels like you are.
