I bought a book! I don't usually buy books, let alone e-books, but I've seen this one thrown around in quite a few recommend reading lists. Besides, anything that makes me a better programmer is worth the investment (not that it was a lot, thanks Google surveys). I've only managed to read through the first few chapters but I've already picked up some nuggets of wisdom and I'm keen to drop some knowledge bombs.

The book explores the idea of codes as a basis for communication - first Morse as a better way to communicate via flashlight, then Braille. It means throwing away traditional paradigms that are ingrained into our minds - "an A is an A and must look or feel like an A". Six dots can repsent 64 different things, and provide more than enough symbols to communicate.

Next we go back to high school and explore the ideas of electricity and circuits. We look at atoms, electrons, batteries, the wires and, of course, the almight switch. Closed and the electrons can flow through the circuit, open and theres no where for these little things to go.

Each of these codes have common features. The components of these codes are only made up of two things: a dot and a dash, a raised or non raised symbol, a switch that can be open or closed. Binary! 1s and 0s. We all know that's how computers interpret our code, and I'm excited to find out more.
