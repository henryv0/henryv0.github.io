This year I started my new job as a junior developer. And so, I embarked on my mission to become a software developer - until I can proudly call myself one without too much impostor syndrome kicking in.

The past two years have seen woeful attempts at learning HTML (decent), CSS (passable) and Javascript (not so decent or passable). I've tried things from codeacademy to a student subscription of Treehouse to the whacky world of YouTube coding videos. I've thrown my email to countless mailing lists and random tutorial websites. I can't even fathom the amount of time I've spent googling and browsing forums - and the anxiety has been real. But goddamn it makes me feel good.

I've gotten to where I am hugely due to luck. I signed up to a gig with a huge corporate firm and so easily could have been doing Excel sheets and Powerpoints for the rest of my career. But... I was dropped into the digital team and that's where the real shit began. And things are flying over my head. So many things. I'm not fully comfortable calling myself a developer yet - that's something I want to earn. There are plenty of gaps in my knowledge that are dying to be filled and the only way is to keep going.
